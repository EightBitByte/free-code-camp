                    Barotrauma takes place in the distant future, during an era where humanity is technologically advanced enough to achieve manned interplanetary space travel.
                    The setting of the game is on Europa, one of Jupiterâ€™s moons, which has become colonized since its initial arrival in 2022. Over many decades, colonies and outposts have been forced to establish under the layer of ice covering the surface of the moon, due to the surface being too irradiated for survival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beneath the ice layer is a vast ocean, used as a transport network between colonies and as a source for natural resources. The ocean also allowed for the creation of transportation shafts that interconnect the colonies throughout the moon. 
                    The ocean itself is inhabited by a number of aquatic creatures, as well as naturally forming cave systems.
                    Over time, the colonies of Europa became more distant and disconnected from Earth, until fifty years ago (putting the present year reasonably at around 2100 - 2200), sometime after the initial colonization of Europa, all contact was mysteriously lost with the rest of civilization for reasons unknown. 
                    The people stranded on Europa were left to fend for themselves, cut off from the supply chain of Earth. With limited resources and the ever advancing Jovian Radiation, the abandoned settlers were forced to delve deeper and deeper into the vast, deadly oceans of Europa.

                <header>Jobs Overview</header>
                <p>
                    Each crew member is assigned a different job. This job determines the character's starting skills (chosen randomly within a certain range), and gear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Job has its own unique set of Talents, when they have gained enough experience, players earn Talent points, which allow them to pick a Talent. 
                    These talents can grant various buffs or bonuses to the player, the whole crew or even the submarine or unlock recipes for unique items. These items can also be crafted by anyone if a Bot has unlocked the recipe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some jobs (<img class="icon" src="https://barotraumagame.com/baro-wiki/images/thumb/1/1f/Captain_Job_Icon.png/60px-Captain_Job_Icon.png"/>captain,  <img class="icon" src="https://barotraumagame.com/baro-wiki/images/thumb/2/2e/Security_Officer_Job_Icon.png/60px-Security_Officer_Job_Icon.png"/>security,  <img class="icon" src="https://barotraumagame.com/baro-wiki/images/thumb/b/b5/Medical_Doctor_Job_Icon.png/60px-Medical_Doctor_Job_Icon.png"/>medical doctor) are capped at a maximum number of players. When the maximum has been reached, players will no longer spawn new characters with that job. 
                    However, existing characters with those jobs will respawn if the player rejoins the server regardless of whether or not it would exceed the cap. The cap does not apply to bots which can be purchased over and above the limit.

                <p>The captain is responsible for commanding the rest of the crew and trying to keep everything running smoothly.
